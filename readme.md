

Welcome to my tutorial Discord Bot!

In this bot I will explain to you the basics of a Discord Bot in the framework "Discord.js".

It's free to use and you are allowed to do what ever you wan't with the bot. You are also allowed to remove watermarks or what ever you like.

I do not provide support on the bot in any way.

Follow my github if you liked it. :)

Start the bot:

Step 1. I really recommend downloading Visual Studio Code for codeing Discord Bots. It's not necessary.

Step 2. dowload node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

Step 6. Download node_modules and package-lock by choosing your folder and then typing "npm install discord.js" in your Visual Studio Code Terminal or your node.js command promt as you downloaded before.

Step 3. Make a bot application and get a token here: https://discord.com/developers/applications

Step 4. Invite your Bot to your Discord Server by copying your client id and changeing permissions here: https://discordapi.com/permissions.html

Step 5. Copypaste your token into the index file.

Step 8. Press the batchfile in the folder.

If you have done the steps correctly, your bot will now be up and running and ready to develop on.
